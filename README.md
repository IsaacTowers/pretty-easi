# q2-makarsa

![ci](https://github.com/BenKaehler/q2-makarsa/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

q2-makarsa is a plugin to incorporate some functionality from the  [SpiecEasi](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) package into the QIIME 2 environment together with additional network visualisation.

## What is involved

### QIIME2

<img align="right" src="images/qiime2.png">

[QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/) is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables researchers to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with publication-quality figures and statistical results.

### SpiecEasi

SpiecEasi (Sparse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological Association and Statistical Inference) is an [R based](https://www.r-project.org/) package which allows the user to infer microbial ecological networks from compositional datasets typically generated from 16S amplicon sequencing. 

### Plug-in Features

q2-makarsa is at the $\alpha$ stage. In addition to wrapping the SpiecEasi package it provides a visualisation for generated networks. As development continues additional features will be listed here.

<!-- qiime makarsa --example-data  -->

## Installation

q2-makarsa requires a working QIIME 2 environment, installed using conda. Please follow the "Natively installing QIIME 2" [instructions](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.11/install/native/). (If that link is outdated, please navigate there in the latest QIIME 2 [docs](https://docs.qiime2.org/).)

Make sure your conda environment is activated (as described in the QIIME 2 installation instructions), then install the dependencies:

```
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge r-spieceasi julia
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(["FlashWeave", "ArgParse", "GraphIO"])'
```

In the same conda environment pip install from the q2-makarsa github repo:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/BenKaehler/q2-makarsa.git
```

## Usage Examples

From within the conda environment create a working folder and move into it
```
mkdir plugin-example
cd plugin-example/
```

This folder will contain the QIIME 2 artefacts produced by q2-makarsa at the completion of each example.

### Basic work flow 

The sequencing data for this example is derived from the [Sponge Microbiome Project](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix077). In particular, we will use data for the [Suberitida](https://www.gbif.org/species/7682289) order of sponges. 

Download the data

```
wget https://github.com/ramellose/networktutorials/raw/master/Workshop%202021/sponges/Suberitida.biom
```
<details><summary>File details</summary>
The data file is in BIOM format with the following attributes

| Attribute        | Value                        |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| "creation-date"  | "2021-01-12T11:53:25.574128" |
| "format-url"     | "http://biom-format.org"     |
| "format-version" | Int32[2, 1]                  |
| "generated-by"   | "BIOM-Format 2.1.6"          |
|                  |                              |
| "id"             | "No Table ID"                |
| "nnz"            | 2023                         |
| "shape"          | Int32[62, 68]                |
| "type"           | ""                           |
</details>

The next step is to import the BIOM file as a frequency [FeatureTable](https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.8/semantic-types/) within QIIME 2.

```
qiime tools import \
	--input-path Suberitida.biom \
	--type 'FeatureTable[Frequency]' \
	--input-format BIOMV210Format \
	--output-path sponge-feature-table.qza
# Imported Suberitida.biom as BIOMV210Format to spongeFeatureTable.qza
```
The QIIME 2 artefact ```spongeFeatureTable.qza``` should exist in the working folder if this command was successful. Now, we are ready to use q2-makarsa to access the SpiecEasi algorithms to infer the microbial network. The most minimal command to generate the network requires the name of artefact containing the FeatureTable and the name of the intended output artefact containing the inferred network. 

```
qiime makarsa spiec-easi \
	--i-table sponge-feature-table.qza \
	--o-network sponge-net.qza
# Saved Network to: sponge-net.qza
```

From the ```sponge-net.qza``` network artefact a visualisation can be created and then viewed

```
qiime makarsa visualise-network \
	--i-network sponge-net.qza \
	--o-visualization sponge-net.qzv
#Saved Visualization to: sponge-net.qzv
qiime tools view sponge-net.qzv
```

The network images should open in your default browser. Alternatively, you can upload ```sponge-net.qva``` to [qiime2view](https://view.qiime2.org/). The network containing the largest number of members is in the tab labelled _Group 1_ , next largest network in the tab _Group 2_, and so on down. Trivial networks of two members and singletons are listed by feature in the _Pairs_ and _Singles_ tab respectively.

### Options 

Several parameter options exist for ```qiime makarsa spiec-easi``` . For a full list of parameters and the defaults execute ```qiime makarsa spiec-easi --help```. Some examples are below.

The algorithm utilised to infer the network can be set with ```-p-method``` parameter switch and one of 3 keywords:
1. ```glasso``` [Graphical LASSO](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/9/3/432/224260) (default)
2. ``mb``  Neighbourhood selection or [Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-34/issue-3/High-dimensional-graphs-and-variable-selection-with-the-Lasso/10.1214/009053606000000281.full) method 
3. ``slr`` Sparse and Low-Rank method

For example to infer the network from the example data using the MB method execute the command

```
qiime makarsa spiec-easi \
	--i-table spongeFeatureTable.qza \
	--o-network sponge-net.qza \
	--p-method mb
```

The remaining parameters relate to selection of the optimal penalty $\lambda$ in each method's [lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) like optimization problem. The network inference algorithms search for the optimal $\lambda$ penalty where the complete graph and an empty graph are at the extremes of the search range. Essentially the process is finding a balance between network sparsity and least-squares fit. 

The range of $\lambda$ values tested is between ```--p-lambda-min-ratio```$\times\lambda_{max}$ and $\lambda_{max}$, where $\lambda_{max}$ is the theoretical upper bound on $\lambda$. This upper bound is  $\max|S|$, the maximum absolute value in the data correlation matrix.

The lambda range is sampled logarithmically ```--p-nlambda``` times.
